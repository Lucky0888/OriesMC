# What is Ories?
Ories is a Minecraft Server that is themed around Modified Survival, and it has cool features like a fully custom crafting system, custom mining system, custom resource pack, and more.

# Is Ories open-source?
NO. All things made by the Ories team you may not use on your server unless explicitly stated. Some things like tool and ore textures, builds and more are NOT made by Ories so you can contact the creators about the rights of those or buy the product from the respective Owner.
